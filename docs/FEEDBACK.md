# Feedback Loop

Froglet's MVP feedback channel is GitHub Discussions:

<https://github.com/armanas/froglet/discussions>

Use GitHub Issues only for concrete bugs, regressions, docs breakage, and
accepted implementation work. Use Discussions for launch feedback, install
reports, payment-rail questions, integration requests, and early use-case
sketches that are not yet actionable issues.

## First Four Weeks

- Analytics: no product analytics for MVP. Keep the launch site zero-analytics
  unless a separate privacy-reviewed analytics change is made.
- Primary channel: GitHub Discussions.
- Secondary channel: GitHub Issues after a discussion or reproduction becomes
  actionable.
- Triage cadence: once per week for the first four weeks after launch.
- Triage output: label or convert each item as bug, docs, install, payment,
  marketplace, agent-host, GPU/batch, launch-copy, or later.

## Triage Checklist

1. Review new Discussions and Issues since the previous triage.
2. Convert reproducible bugs into Issues with observed commands, versions, and
   logs.
3. Keep unsupported claims explicit: hosted trial does not prove paid rails,
   persistent identity, marketplace depth, batch fan-out, GPU routing, or Tor
   hosted reachability.
4. Add high-signal install failures to the quickstart or self-install docs.
5. Record payment-rail feedback separately for Lightning, Stripe, and x402 so
   post-MVP rail decisions stay evidence-based.
