Whatever rail moves the money, Froglet produces a signed, hash-linked record of
what was authorised, under which limits, and what the executing party attested
to — verifiable offline by anyone, with no node and no account.

Verify a chain yourself in one command:

```bash
cargo run -p froglet-verify -- conformance/kernel_v1.json

## Overview

The current product candidate starts with **“Make this catalog usable by another
agent.”** Codex or Claude Code can prepare selected JSON, typed CSV, or SQLite
data, or a small Wasm function; run a local example; ask for exact publication
approval; and return a provider/service share link. Native setup preserves
existing agent settings. Recipients use the same native integration without npm.

See [the publishing workflow](docs-site/src/content/docs/learn/share-services.mdx)
and [the qualification gates](docs/RELEASE.md#effortless-publishing-qualification).
This is an uncommitted candidate: clean-machine agent tests, the real public
relay journey, and first-time-user acceptance remain release gates. Supported
targets are Apple Silicon macOS and Linux x86_64/arm64. The host must stay online.

Froglet gives one signed economic primitive for three product shapes:

| Shape | Description |
|---|---|
| **Named Services** | Discoverable, published service endpoints |
| **Data-Backed Services** | Services backed by bot-authored data or projects |
| **Open-Ended Compute** | Raw compute targeted via `provider_id` or `provider_url` |

The primary bot-facing integration surfaces are intentionally simple:

- One OpenClaw/NemoClaw plugin id: `froglet` (at `integrations/openclaw/froglet/`)
- One MCP server under `integrations/mcp/froglet/`, published as
  `froglet-mcp` for `npx froglet-mcp`, plus a dependency-minimal native
  bridge in `froglet-node mcp`
- Both surfaces register a single agent-facing tool named `froglet` to
  the host (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.). The headline
  action is two-step `marketplace_publish`: the first call is a
  non-mutating plan, and the second must carry the exact approved
  `consent_hash`. Both native and JavaScript adapters delegate to the same
  Rust publication module and provider-control contract.
- The `froglet-node` binary is both the daemon (running as a provider)
  and the author CLI (`froglet-node init` / `build` / `publish` /
  `whoami`, `prepare-service`, `invoke`, `doctor`, and `check-updates`).
  `status --open --json` returns a short-lived read-only local status URL.

Bots should be able to create small scriptable services directly, validate them
locally, and publish them without starting from OCI images.
OCI containers remain a supported packaging and deployment path.

---

## Product Model

- Any Froglet node can publish resources and invoke remote resources
- Published resources are execution bindings backed by bot-authored projects,
  explicit source, or prebuilt artifacts
- Easy bot authoring and local checking of scriptable services is a core
  product requirement
- Identity is first-class in signed artifacts
- Clearnet HTTPS, outbound relay HTTPS, and Tor v3 onion transport are
  supported registration paths for self-hosted providers. Bootstrap plans the
  official relay URL and suffix by default but keeps them dormant; publication
  fails closed until an exact durable grant makes the endpoint ready. Planned
  configuration is not a claim that its public operator service is deployed.

> [!NOTE]
> Marketplace, ranking, incentive, and broker policy live above the protocol.
> Payment rails are adapter-level surfaces for local or self-hosted operators,
> not normal buyer onboarding.
> Lightning, Stripe, and x402 are the launch adapters in this repo. Lightning
> and x402 have standardized kernel settlement methods with conformance
> vectors; Stripe's `stripe_mpp.v1` receipt shape is standardized but attested
> rather than cryptographic. Only Lightning escrow uses the signed
> invoice-bundle flow. x402's wire format is settled
> (`x402.eip3009.v1`, [`conformance/x402_v1.json`](conformance/x402_v1.json))
> but its rail is not: no publish-path exposure and no live transcript on any
> network. The first-party hosted `try.froglet.dev` trial is free-only: it
> uses `demo.add` as the canonical proof and exposes optional
> `demo.fetch-witness`, `demo.hash-verify`, and `demo.notarize` follow-ups for
> stronger evidence. Hosted paid rails must not be claimed live until Lightning
> and Stripe have public payment transcripts, and users should not be asked to
> manage LND channels or payment secrets just to try Froglet.

<details>
<summary><strong>Discovery & Compute model</strong></summary>

- Named services and data services are discovered through discovery
- Open-ended compute uses the provider's direct compute offer via
  `run_compute`, targeted with `provider_id` or `provider_url`
- Publication and bootstrap adapters may include Nostr-style publication
  without making any single relay or network the kernel source of truth

</details>

## Components

Product-wise, Froglet is one node that can both provide and consume.
The reference implementation exposes these binaries:

| Binary | Purpose | Default Port |
|---|---|---|
| `froglet-node` | Provider and/or runtime node (role configured via env) | `8080` / `8081` |

> [!TIP]
> Marketplace integration is part of the public Froglet surface. Runtimes can
> point at the default public marketplace with `FROGLET_MARKETPLACE_URL`;
> providers can self-register there after exposing a public HTTPS URL,
> identity-assigned relay URL, Tor v3 onion URL, or claimed
> `*.providers.froglet.dev` hostname. See
> [docs/MARKETPLACE.md](docs/MARKETPLACE.md).

---

## Prerequisites

**Binary install (quickest):** curl, tar, sha256sum (Linux) or shasum (macOS).
Supported: Linux x86_64/arm64, macOS arm64.

**Build from source:** Rust 1.91+, Python 3.12+ (for tests), Node 18+ with npm
(for Claude Code/Codex MCP setup and integration tests).

**Docker (optional fallback/contributor stack):** Docker with Compose v2.

## Quick Start

Canonical onboarding lives in
[docs-site/src/content/docs/docs.mdx](docs-site/src/content/docs/docs.mdx)
(the `learn/` index remains as a legacy route).
Use the repo README for the product and codebase overview, the docs-site
manual for the public launch path, and `docs/` for specs, operator notes, and
integration reference.

The public launch story still has exactly two entry points:

### 1. Try In Cloud

- Start with
  [docs-site/src/content/docs/learn/cloud-trial.mdx](docs-site/src/content/docs/learn/cloud-trial.mdx)
- Contract reference: [docs/HOSTED_TRIAL.md](docs/HOSTED_TRIAL.md)
- Session tokens on `try.froglet.dev` authorize only
  `POST /v1/runtime/deals` and `GET /v1/runtime/deals/{deal_id}`
- `try.froglet.dev` is the only public hosted-trial ingress; `ai.froglet.dev`
  does not expose session minting or hosted demo deal routes directly
- The hosted demo catalog has five free services: `demo.add`, `demo.echo`,
  `demo.fetch-witness`, `demo.hash-verify`, and `demo.notarize`
- `demo.add` is the canonical discover → deal → result → receipt proof;
  witness/hash/notarize flows are optional higher-signal follow-ups
- The hosted trial still does not prove paid rails, persistent identity,
  service publication, marketplace depth, or general runtime access

### 2. Run Locally

- Start with
  [docs-site/src/content/docs/learn/quickstart.mdx](docs-site/src/content/docs/learn/quickstart.mdx)
- Then use
  [docs-site/src/content/docs/learn/agents.mdx](docs-site/src/content/docs/learn/agents.mdx)
  and
  [docs-site/src/content/docs/learn/payment-rails.mdx](docs-site/src/content/docs/learn/payment-rails.mdx)
- Self-host and operator follow-ons live in [docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md),
  [docs/GCP_SINGLE_VM.md](docs/GCP_SINGLE_VM.md), and
  [docs/MARKETPLACE.md](docs/MARKETPLACE.md)

Minimal full local stack from zero:

```bash

if command -v sha256sum >/dev/null 2>&1; then actual="$(sha256sum "$bootstrap" | awk '{print $1}')";
elif command -v shasum >/dev/null 2>&1; then actual="$(shasum -a 256 "$bootstrap" | awk '{print $1}')";
else actual="$(openssl dgst -sha256 "$bootstrap" | sed 's/^.*= //')"; fi
[ "$actual" = "$bootstrap_digest" ]
chmod 0700 "$bootstrap"
VERSION="$tag" sh "$bootstrap" plan
# Show the complete plan and wait for approval. Then copy its exact hash:
VERSION="$tag" sh "$bootstrap" execute '<install_approval_hash>'
rm -f "$bootstrap" "$metadata"
```

`plan` is the safe default and writes nothing outside its temporary workspace.
It resolves the immutable release, verified manifest and target-platform binary
asset digests, exact bootstrap/install/configuration script digests, persistent
paths, and service-manager impact into one canonical approval hash. `execute`
recomputes that contract and stops before any persistent write if the release,
script bytes, profile, paths, or supplied hash changed.

After approval, the agent bootstrap verifies a Release Bundle, installs the checksum-verified
`froglet-node`, starts the native dual-role service through launchd/systemd,
writes native MCP config, and returns only after health plus a non-seeding MCP
status proof and a transient read-only data proof that is confirmed-unpublished.
The proof first requires an empty active-offer feed and no lifecycle for its
exact service ID, records a private cleanup intent before publishing, and
removes both its offer and authoring directory only after an empty-feed check.
A failed proof attempts exact unpublish while the service is still live and
preserves a recovery marker if cleanup cannot be proved.
A digest-pinned dual-role GHCR image is the fallback
when native service management is unavailable.

The approval plan includes the official relay endpoint and DNS suffix by
default. This is dormant configuration: it derives an exact planned HTTPS URL
but opens no WSS connection and exposes no service before an exact durable
publication grant. Set both `FROGLET_RELAY_URL=''` and
`FROGLET_RELAY_PUBLIC_SUFFIX=''` before `plan` to opt out. The first-party
DNS/TLS endpoint is not yet live-proven, so relay publication remains an
explicit external gate rather than an install success claim. See
[docs/RELAY.md](docs/RELAY.md). The implementation/evidence matrix in
[docs/AGENT_FIRST_PUBLICATION_PLAN.md](docs/AGENT_FIRST_PUBLICATION_PLAN.md)
tracks which clean-host and external gates remain open.

From a trusted checkout, run the disposable-host proof with
`bash scripts/fresh_host_quickstart_smoke.sh`.

The lower-level `scripts/install.sh` is an internal release-bundle installer;
agents should use the approval-gated bootstrap above.

Source-checkout Compose and generated host-side agent configs depend on
`FROGLET_HOST_READABLE_CONTROL_TOKEN=true`; the default user path is the
no-clone `/agent` bootstrap. The quickstart page carries the step-by-step
MCP-first explanation, payment-rail decisions, Tor registration, managed
subdomains, and contributor/source-mode fallbacks.

<details>
<summary><strong>Running binaries directly (without Compose)</strong></summary>

```bash
# Provider node
FROGLET_NODE_ROLE=provider \
FROGLET_PRICE_EXEC_WASM=10 \
FROGLET_PAYMENT_BACKEND=lightning \
FROGLET_LIGHTNING_MODE=mock \
cargo run -p froglet --bin froglet-node
```

```bash
# Runtime node
FROGLET_NODE_ROLE=runtime \
FROGLET_PAYMENT_BACKEND=lightning \
FROGLET_LIGHTNING_MODE=mock \
cargo run -p froglet --bin froglet-node
```

The normal model is one node running both provider and runtime roles
(`FROGLET_NODE_ROLE=dual`), so it can publish local resources and invoke
remote ones.

Set `FROGLET_MARKETPLACE_URL` on runtime nodes to search through an external
marketplace. Providers can self-register with the default public marketplace
after they advertise a matching public HTTPS origin, assigned relay HTTPS URL,
Tor v3 onion URL, or claimed `*.providers.froglet.dev` hostname.

## Bot Surfaces

OpenClaw, NemoClaw, and MCP-compatible hosts are the primary bot-facing
surfaces today. Distribution status and marketplace/plugin ordering live in
[PLUGIN_DISTRIBUTION.md](docs/PLUGIN_DISTRIBUTION.md).

### OpenClaw & NemoClaw

Use the shared plugin package in
[integrations/openclaw/froglet](integrations/openclaw/froglet).
Current OpenClaw plugin install/inspect and gateway invocation require
Node.js `22.14.0` or newer. Gateway-mediated local actions should launch with
`FROGLET_PROVIDER_AUTH_TOKEN_PATH` and `FROGLET_RUNTIME_AUTH_TOKEN_PATH`
pointing at the local `data/runtime/` token files.

<details>
<summary><strong>Configuration keys</strong></summary>

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hostProduct` | Target host product |
| `providerUrl` | Provider/public API base URL |
| `runtimeUrl` | Runtime API base URL |
| `providerAuthTokenPath` | Path to the provider control token |
| `runtimeAuthTokenPath` | Path to the runtime auth token |
| `baseUrl` | Legacy single-surface fallback URL |
| `authTokenPath` | Legacy single-token fallback path |
| `requestTimeoutMs` | HTTP request timeout |
| `defaultSearchLimit` | Default discovery result limit |
| `maxSearchLimit` | Maximum discovery result limit |

</details>

The generated local OpenClaw config uses the split provider/runtime keys above.
Legacy `baseUrl` and `authTokenPath` remain supported for single-surface
configs such as the checked-in NemoClaw examples.

The one `froglet` tool covers:

- Service discovery and invocation
- Agent-grade service publication via `marketplace_publish`
- Local artifact publication via `publish_artifact`
- Settlement visibility and current marketplace wrappers
- Status and task polling
- Exact install approval via non-mutating `plan_install`, then approved command
  generation via `get_install_guide`
- Post-install workflow planning via `plan_use_case`
- Raw compute

<details>
<summary><strong>Important behavior notes</strong></summary>

- `summary` is metadata only; it does not generate code
- `publish_artifact` is the current local publication path
- `run_compute` is the low-level path for open-ended compute and should include
  `provider_id` or `provider_url`
- Project authoring, log tailing, and node restart are not part of the current
  public tool API

</details>

### MCP: native default and JavaScript compatibility

The no-clone native install configures the released binary directly:

```text
froglet-node mcp
```

This bridge needs no Node.js runtime. Its deliberately focused `froglet` tool
supports `status`, `invoke_service`, two-step
`marketplace_publish`, and publication status/logs/pause/resume/rollback/
confirmed-unpublish. Durable cloud-adapter work is separately visible through
managed-operation status, confirmed reconciliation, and confirmed compensation.
`local_proof` is available only when an operator has
deliberately enabled the bundled demo catalog; clean installation does not.
Publication delegates to the same canonical project
loader, consent logic, and provider-control API as the CLI.

The JavaScript MCP package is the broader compatibility and contributor
surface for discovery, settlement, install planning, raw compute, and existing
host integrations:

```bash
npx froglet-mcp
```

The npm package defaults to `FROGLET_PROFILE=local`, with provider/runtime URLs
pointing at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` and `http://127.0.0.1:8081`. Agents should
call `status` first. If the local node or token files are missing, call
`plan_install`, show its immutable release tag, manifest/bootstrap SHA-256
values, persistent paths, process-manager impact, and exact command preview,
then wait for approval. Only after approval, pass the returned `release_tag`
and `install_approval_hash` unchanged to `get_install_guide` and run its
verified-temp-file command through the host shell. After local health is
verified, use `plan_use_case` before
implementing consumer, provider, evidence, payments, batch, or GPU workflows.
Batch and GPU planning stays truthful: current MCP can plan and verify
boundaries. GPU capability advertisement, generic-compute offer metadata,
Docker `--gpus all` gating, no-CPU-fallback errors, and one self-hosted GCP T4
container workload with a signed receipt are verified. True batch fan-out, GPU
scheduling/provider selection, marketplace GPU routing, and production capacity
management remain separate work. The public no-install proof remains the HTTP
flow at `https://froglet.dev/llms.txt`; it is not an installed MCP action.

For a local node, use the local profile:

```bash
FROGLET_PROFILE=local \
FROGLET_PROVIDER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
FROGLET_RUNTIME_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8081 \
FROGLET_PROVIDER_AUTH_TOKEN_PATH=/absolute/path/to/froglet/data/runtime/froglet-control.token \
FROGLET_RUNTIME_AUTH_TOKEN_PATH=/absolute/path/to/froglet/data/runtime/auth.token \
  npx froglet-mcp
```

From a source checkout, the same server can be run directly:

```bash
npm ci --prefix integrations/mcp/froglet
node integrations/mcp/froglet/server.js
```

The npm, source-checkout, and digest-pinned MCP-image modes expose the broader
JavaScript surface over MCP stdio. The native mode exposes the smaller
dependency-free publication/lifecycle surface above; it does not claim action
parity with JavaScript.

For normal users, the `/agent` bootstrap writes the local MCP config without a
repo clone. From a source checkout, contributors can still generate the exact
config file instead of editing JSON or TOML by hand:

```bash
cd froglet && ./scripts/setup-agent.sh --target claude-code
cd froglet && ./scripts/setup-agent.sh --target codex
```

---

## Portable Managed Hosting and OCI Isolation

`froglet-service/v4` expresses managed hosting as a provider-neutral
`target`/`profile`. It does not contain AWS regions, Lightsail names, Fly apps,
ECR repositories, or cloud SDK types. The sibling
[Managed Deployment operator](https://github.com/armanas/froglet-services/tree/main/services/operator)
implements the corresponding portable desired-state lifecycle through the
current Lightsail compatibility adapter or generic SSH + OCI adapter and
returns the same normalized result shape. Publish-engine-to-operator wiring
and credentialed live canaries remain separate open gates.

V3 manifests remain readable. `hosting.default = "fly"` and `hosting.fly.*`
are deprecated compatibility inputs only; new authoring uses v4 `managed`, and
provider selection belongs in operator-owned adapter configuration. See
[docs/PUBLICATION_CONTRACT.md](docs/PUBLICATION_CONTRACT.md#service-manifest-v4-and-hosting-portability).

Arbitrary OCI execution does not give the Froglet Node a Docker/Podman socket.
The node sends a digest-only, bounded, capability-reduced request to an
authenticated worker endpoint configured by `FROGLET_OCI_WORKER_URL` and
`FROGLET_OCI_WORKER_TOKEN_PATH`. The reference
[OCI worker](https://github.com/armanas/froglet-services/tree/main/services/oci-worker)
owns rootless engine access and defaults to read-only, non-root, no-network
execution. With no worker configured, OCI execution fails closed.

---

## Verification

### Verifying artifact chains (what a counterparty does)

`froglet-verify` is a standalone offline verifier: no node, no network, no
account, and no clock unless you supply one. Point it at a chain and it checks
every envelope signature, every per-artifact semantic rule, and every hash link
between artifacts.

```bash
cargo run -p froglet-verify -- conformance/kernel_v1.json
```

It accepts a single artifact, a JSON array, a `/v1/feed` page, or a conformance
fixture, from a file or stdin; `--json` emits a machine-readable report and
`--now <unix>` turns on expiry checks. Exit codes: `0` valid, `1` invalid,
`2` usage error.

The Rust facade, browser WASM build, and in-repo Rust conformance runners share
the `froglet-protocol` implementation. [python/froglet-verify](python/froglet-verify)
is independently implemented and checks the same public vectors. Multiple Rust
runners exercise distribution paths; they do not provide implementation diversity. See
[conformance/README.md](conformance/README.md) for what a conforming runner must
assert, and [docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md) for the normative rules.

### Build and repo checks

**Targeted checks:**

```bash
cargo check -q
cargo test -q --lib
node --check integrations/openclaw/froglet/index.js
node --check integrations/openclaw/froglet/scripts/doctor.mjs
node --test integrations/openclaw/froglet/test/plugin.test.js \
  integrations/openclaw/froglet/test/config-profiles.test.mjs \
  integrations/openclaw/froglet/test/doctor.test.mjs \
  integrations/openclaw/froglet/test/froglet-client.test.mjs
npm run check:mcp
npm run test:mcp
```

**Full repo checks:**

```bash
./scripts/strict_checks.sh
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Compose-backed smoke tests</strong></summary>

Optional compose-backed bot-surface smoke coverage:

```bash
FROGLET_RUN_COMPOSE_SMOKE=1 ./scripts/strict_checks.sh
```

Manual compose-backed smoke commands:

```bash

## Current Scope

**In this repo now:**

- Protocol and supporting specifications under `docs/` and `conformance/` —
  stability guarantees in [docs/VERSIONING.md](docs/VERSIONING.md); to build a
  second implementation in another language, start from the canonical test
  vectors in [`conformance/kernel_v1.json`](conformance/kernel_v1.json) (guide:
  [froglet.dev/spec/conformance](https://froglet.dev/spec/conformance/))
- Reference Froglet node implementation: a single `froglet-node` binary
  serving split provider and runtime planes (published as `froglet-provider`
  and `froglet-runtime` container images)
- OpenClaw source-plugin integration and shared NemoClaw plugin code, with
  host-specific verification status documented separately
- Native dependency-minimal MCP bridge plus the broader JavaScript MCP server
  for external agent hosts and automations
- Python-backed helpers and tests for the public node and protocol surface
- Local project authoring, build, test, and publish flows for bot-authored
  services
- Direct artifact publication for prebuilt Wasm and OCI-backed profiles
- Reference execution profiles for Wasm, Python, container, and confidential
  execution paths
- Local/self-hosted reference settlement support for operator-controlled
  Lightning, Stripe, and x402
- Clearnet and outbound relay transports plus optional self-hosted Tor and
  Nostr-facing adapter support; live public relay readiness is an external
  deployment gate, not inferred from the client implementation
- Tests, validation scripts, and release docs for the public repo surface
- Public-facing self-host documentation and examples

**Later or separately deployed:**

- First-party hosted paid rail claims for Lightning and Stripe, pending public
  live transcripts; hosted x402 remains desirable but non-blocking
- The hosted `try.froglet.dev` gateway's private operational lifecycle
- Higher-layer marketplace ranking, reputation, and policy services
- Long-running batch orchestration, which remains out of scope for the current
  v1 runtime surface
- Credentialed live proof for the provider-neutral Lightsail and generic SSH +
  OCI Managed Deployment adapters maintained in `froglet-services`
- Additional provisioning adapters for GCP, OVH, and similar providers when
  demand justifies them; no new provider enum belongs in the manifest
- Zip or archive packaging as a first-class execution submission format
- First-party hosted control-plane operations and runbooks

> [!WARNING]
> Execution hardening is not uniform across all runtimes.
> Wasm is the strongest runnable in-process isolation path. Confidential/TEE
> artifact types remain protocol scaffolding only: this build rejects mock
> attestation/key-release policies and does not advertise `tee.*` runtimes.
> Python requires Linux Landlock ABI v3 plus seccomp; OCI/container execution
> inherits the separately configured worker's isolation characteristics.
